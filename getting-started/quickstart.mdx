## Overview

This guide walks you through connecting your first integration using Tadata's optimized connectors. You'll connect Slack and test it in just 3 steps.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:**
  - A Tadata account ([sign up here](https://app.tadata.com/signup))
  - A Slack workspace (for this example)
</Info>

## Step 1: Choose Integration

1. Log in to your [Tadata Dashboard](https://app.tadata.com)
2. Navigate to **Connectors**
3. Find **Slack**

<Tip>
  For this quickstart, we'll use Slack for team communication. You can connect any of our integrations.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Authenticate

1. Click **Connect** on the Slack connector
2. Authorize with OAuth (redirects to Slack)
3. Grant permissions and select your workspace

<Check>
  Done! Your Slack integration is connected and optimized automatically.
</Check>

## Step 3: Test in Playground

Now verify your integration works:

1. Navigate to **Toolsets** in your dashboard
2. Find your newly created Slack toolset
3. Click **Playground**
4. Try a command:

```text
Post "Hello from Tadata!" to #general
```

You'll see the tool execute in real-time and your message appear in Slack.

<Check>
  Your integration is working! You can now connect it to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or use it programmatically.
</Check>
