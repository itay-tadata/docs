## Connector

A **connector** is a pre-built integration for a specific service (like Slack, GitHub, or Linear). Each connector includes:

- Authentication setup (OAuth or API key)
- Available tools/operations
- Optimized responses for AI usage

**Example:** The Slack connector lets AI agents post messages, create channels, and search conversations.

## Toolset

A **toolset** is a collection of connectors packaged together for your AI agent to use. You can combine multiple connectors into one toolset.

**Examples:**
- Single connector: Just Slack
- Multiple connectors: Slack + Linear + GitHub (for a triage workflow)

Each toolset gets a unique URL that you connect to your AI agent.

## Tool

A **tool** is a specific operation within a connector. Tools are what your AI agent actually executes.

**Examples from Slack connector:**
- `post_message` - Send a message to a channel
- `list_channels` - Get all channels in workspace
- `create_channel` - Create a new channel

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**MCP** is the standard protocol that lets AI agents communicate with external tools. Think of it as the language AI agents use to call tools.

Tadata handles all the MCP complexity for you - you don't need to understand the protocol to use it.

## Agent

An **agent** is an AI system that can use tools to perform tasks. Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor, or your custom AI implementation.

Agents use MCP to discover available tools and execute them based on user requests.

## Common Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **OAuth** | Secure authentication method where you authorize Tadata to access a service on your behalf |
| **Playground** | Interactive environment in Tadata to test your toolsets before connecting to agents |
| **Deployment** | A specific version of your toolset configuration |
| **Integration** | Another term for connector - a connection to an external service |

## How It All Fits Together

```
1. You connect a Connector (e.g., Slack)
2. Tadata creates a Toolset with available Tools
3. Your Agent connects to the Toolset via MCP
4. Agent can now execute Tools (e.g., post_message)
```
