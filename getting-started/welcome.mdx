## What is Tadata?

Tadata is an **AI-agent builder** that streamlines work across tools. Connect your SaaS stack and create agents that work how you want them to. We offer pre-built connectors for many tools (Linear, GitHub, Sentry, Slack, Render, Supabase, and more) and let you bring your own APIs. Build and deploy agents in minutes with no setup required.

## The Problem

The hardest part of building an agent isn't the AI - it's figuring out authentication, managing context efficiently, and setting up integrations that actually work. OAuth flows break, APIs return megabytes of irrelevant data that waste tokens, and you spend weeks maintaining connections instead of building features. We got you covered.

## The Solution

Tadata provides optimized, pre-configured integrations ready to use immediately:
