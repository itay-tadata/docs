title: "Code Indexing"
description: "Add code search to your toolsets"
---

## Overview

Code Indexing adds a `search-code` tool to your toolset, allowing AI agents to search code repositories without loading entire codebases into context.

Connect public GitHub repositories and Tadata handles the rest.

## Setup

1. Go to your toolset configuration and enable Code Indexing
2. Enter one or more public GitHub repository URLs
3. Click OK - Tadata indexes everything in the background

The `search-code` tool is now available. Test it in the Playground.

## Using search-code

Your AI agent can now search code:

```text Example Query
"Find the authentication function"
```

The tool returns relevant code snippets with file paths and line numbers.

## Staying Updated

**Manual Reindex**: Click "Reindex Now" in your toolset configuration after major code changes

**Automatic Re-syncing**: Enable automated re-syncing to keep the tool up to date automatically

## Use Cases
