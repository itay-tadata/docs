## What Are Connectors?

Connectors give AI agents the ability to interact with external services and data. Tadata offers two types of connectors:

### 1. Service Integrations

Connect your agent to existing external services like Slack, GitHub, Linear, and more. Each integration provides tools that let agents interact with that service.

**Examples:**

    Post messages, search conversations, create channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="Linear" icon="/logos/linear.svg">
    Create and update tickets, add comments, search issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="GitHub" icon="/logos/github.svg">
    Create issues, list PRs, search code, manage releases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sentry" icon="/logos/sentry.svg">
    List errors, get error details, resolve issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notion" icon="/logos/notion.svg">
    Search pages, create documents, update databases
  </Card>
  <Card title="And 50+ more" icon="ellipsis">
    New integrations added daily
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Agent Capabilities

Give your agent new capabilities like searching documentation, searching code, web search, and memory. These aren't connections to external services - they're built-in tools that extend what your agent can do.

  <Card title="Knowledge Search" icon="book" href="/connectors/knowledge-indexing">
    **Search documentation sites**

    Point to any public website (like your docs) and your agent can search it to answer questions. No need to connect to a specific service.

    Example: Index your help center so support agents can find answers instantly.

  <Card title="Code Search" icon="code" href="/connectors/code-indexing">
    **Search GitHub repositories**

    Point to public GitHub repos and your agent can search the codebase for relevant code and implementations.

    Example: Let triage agents find code related to production errors.

## How Connectors Work

1. **Connect Once**: Authenticate with OAuth or API key (Tadata stores credentials securely)
2. **Add to Toolset**: Select which connectors your agent needs
3. **Deploy**: Your agent can now use all the tools from those connectors

Tadata handles authentication, tool definitions, response optimization, and API rate limiting automatically.

## Browse Available Connectors

We offer many pre-built connectors for popular services, with new connectors added daily.
