description: "Add documentation search to your toolsets"
---

## Overview

Knowledge Indexing adds a `search-docs` tool to your toolset, allowing AI agents to search your documentation without loading entire docs into context.

Connect any public documentation website and Tadata handles the rest.

## Setup

1. Go to your toolset configuration and enable Knowledge Indexing
2. Enter your documentation URL (e.g., `https://docs.yourcompany.com`)
3. Click OK - Tadata indexes everything in the background

The `search-docs` tool is now available. Test it in the Playground.

## Using search-docs

Your AI agent can now search documentation:

```text Example Query
"Search docs for authentication guide"
```

The tool returns relevant snippets with links to full documentation.

## Staying Updated

**Manual Reindex**: Click "Reindex Now" in your toolset configuration when you update your documentation

**Automatic Re-syncing**: Enable automated re-syncing to keep the tool up to date automatically
