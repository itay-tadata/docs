## Connect a Service

### OAuth Connection (Recommended)

Most connectors use OAuth for secure, one-click authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect">
    Find your connector and click the **Connect** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    You'll be redirected to the service (e.g., Linear, GitHub, Slack)

    Review the requested permissions:
    - Read access to issues, projects, etc.
    - Write access to create, update, delete

    Click **Authorize** to grant access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Workspace/Organization">
    Some services require you to select a workspace or organization:
    - Linear: Choose workspace
    - Slack: Choose workspace and channel
    - GitHub: Choose organization or personal account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You'll be redirected back to Tadata with a success message

    Your account is now connected!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Tadata automatically handles token refresh. Your connection stays active without manual intervention.
</Check>

### API Key Connection

Some connectors support API key authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Find your API key in the service's settings:
    - Sentry: Settings → API Keys
    - Supabase: Project Settings → API
    - MongoDB: Security → API Keys
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter API Key">
    In Tadata, paste your API key into the connection form

    Configure additional settings if needed:
    - Base URL (for self-hosted services)
    - Organization ID
    - Project ID
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify the API key works

    Tadata will make a simple API call to confirm authentication
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to complete the connection
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  API keys are transmitted over HTTPS only and are not stored permanently by Tadata (passthrough mode).
</Warning>

## Select Tools to Enable

After connecting, choose which tools to expose to your AI agents:

### Enable All Tools (Recommended for Getting Started)

Click **Enable All** to add all available tools to your toolset.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility for your AI agent
- Discover useful tools you didn't know existed
- Easy to disable specific tools later

**Cons:**
- More tools = more context for AI to process
- Potentially exposes sensitive operations

### Select Specific Tools

Or manually select tools:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linear Example">
    **Read Operations** (Safe):
    - ✅ `list_issues` - Fetch issues
    - ✅ `list_projects` - Get all projects
    - ✅ `search_issues` - Search by keyword

    **Write Operations** (Requires Care):
    - ⚠️ `create_issue` - Create new issues
    - ⚠️ `update_issue` - Modify existing issues
    - ⚠️ `delete_issue` - Delete issues (careful!)

    **Recommended**: Enable reads first, add writes after testing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub Example">
    **Read Operations**:
    - ✅ `list_pull_requests`
    - ✅ `get_pull_request`
    - ✅ `list_issues`

    **Write Operations**:
    - ⚠️ `create_pull_request`
    - ⚠️ `merge_pull_request`
    - ⚠️ `create_release`

    **Destructive Operations**:
    - ❌ `delete_repository` - Block until ready!
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Slack Example">
    **Communication**:
    - ✅ `post_message` - Send messages to channels
    - ✅ `create_thread` - Start conversation threads
    - ✅ `list_channels` - Get all channels

    **Management**:
    - ⚠️ `create_channel` - Create new channels
    - ⚠️ `archive_channel` - Archive channels
    - ⚠️ `invite_user` - Add users to channels
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Start conservative. Enable read-only tools first, test thoroughly, then gradually add write operations.
</Tip>

## Create New Toolset vs. Add to Existing

When connecting a connector, choose:

### Option 1: Create New Toolset

Best for:
- Your first connector
- Logically separate use cases (e.g., separate "Support Tools" from "DevOps Tools")
- Testing a connector before adding to production toolset

**Result:** New toolset at `{new-name}.mcp.tadata.com`

### Option 2: Add to Existing Toolset

Best for:
- Combining related services (e.g., Sentry + GitHub + Slack for triage)
- Building comprehensive workflows
- Following a [Recipe](/recipes/introduction)

**Result:** Tools added to existing toolset URL

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Manage Connected Accounts

### View Connected Accounts

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Connected Accounts**
2. See all active connections:
   - Service name and logo
   - Connected user/organization
   - Connection date
   - Last used timestamp

### Reconnect Account

If a token expires or is revoked:

1. Find the account in **Connected Accounts**
2. Click **Reconnect**
3. Re-authorize with the service
4. Your toolsets continue working immediately

<Info>
  Tadata notifies you via email if a connection fails or requires reconnection.
</Info>

### Disconnect Account

To remove a connection:

1. Find the account in **Connected Accounts**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Disconnecting an account will break any toolsets using that connector. Proceed with caution.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use OAuth When Available" icon="shield-check">
    OAuth is more secure than API keys:
    - Tokens are scoped to specific permissions
    - Tokens can be revoked without changing passwords
    - Tadata handles token refresh automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Least Privilege" icon="lock">
    Only enable tools your agent actually needs:
    - Start with read-only tools
    - Add write operations carefully
    - Block destructive tools (delete, archive) by default
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Separate Accounts for Automation" icon="user-robot">
    Create dedicated service accounts for AI agents:
    - Easier to audit and track actions
    - Can be revoked without affecting human users
    - Clearer permission boundaries
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate API Keys Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    If using API keys (not OAuth):
    - Rotate keys every 90 days
    - Use restricted/scoped keys when possible
    - Monitor key usage in service dashboards
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Group Related Connectors" icon="layer-group">
    Combine connectors that work together:
    - **Triage**: Sentry + GitHub + Slack
    - **Support**: Linear + Intercom + Notion
    - **DevOps**: GitHub + Render + PagerDuty

    See [Recipes](/recipes/introduction) for pre-configured combinations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Toolset Names" icon="tag">
    Name toolsets clearly:
    - ✅ "Production Triage Agent"
    - ✅ "Customer Support Tools"
    - ❌ "My Toolset"
    - ❌ "Test 123"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Environments" icon="sitemap">
    Create different toolsets for:
    - Development (testing, staging APIs)
    - Production (live services)
    - Personal (individual use)

    Use [Server Groups](/getting-started/key-concepts#server-groups) to organize.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test in Playground First" icon="flask">
    Before connecting to Claude or Cursor:
    1. Test each tool in the [Playground](/guides/testing-playground)
    2. Verify authentication works
    3. Check that responses are sensible
    4. Confirm permissions are correct
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start with Read-Only Operations" icon="eye">
    Initial testing flow:
    1. Enable only read tools (`list_*`, `get_*`, `search_*`)
    2. Test in Playground: "List my Linear issues"
    3. Verify data looks correct
    4. Then add write tools (`create_*`, `update_*`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Test Workspaces" icon="vial">
    When available, connect test/staging workspaces first:
    - Linear: Use a test workspace
    - Slack: Create a test channel
    - GitHub: Use a test repository

    Validate everything works before connecting production.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth authorization fails" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms**: Redirect fails, "Authorization denied" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Disable popup blockers
    - Try in an incognito/private window
    - Verify you have admin access to the workspace/organization
    - Check that the service is not experiencing an outage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API key connection fails" icon="key">
    **Symptoms**: "Invalid API key" or "Unauthorized" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Double-check the API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
    - Verify the key has not expired
    - Confirm the key has necessary permissions
    - Check the base URL is correct (for self-hosted services)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools not working after connection" icon="wrench">
    **Symptoms**: "Authentication failed" in Playground

    **Solutions**:
    - Check if token has expired (reconnect account)
    - Verify the connected account has access to requested resources
    - Confirm tool permissions are set to "Allow" not "Block"
    - Review error logs in Analytics for specific error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a connector I need" icon="magnifying-glass">
