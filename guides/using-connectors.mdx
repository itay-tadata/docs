## Overview

Connectors are pre-built integrations for popular services. This guide covers how to connect them and configure your toolsets.

## Connect a Service

### OAuth Connection (Recommended)

Most connectors use OAuth for secure, one-click authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect">
    Find your connector and click the **Connect** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    You'll be redirected to the service (e.g., Linear, GitHub, Slack)

    Review the requested permissions:
    - Read access to issues, projects, etc.
    - Write access to create, update, delete

    Click **Authorize** to grant access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Workspace/Organization">
    Some services require you to select a workspace or organization:
    - Linear: Choose workspace
    - Slack: Choose workspace and channel
    - GitHub: Choose organization or personal account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You'll be redirected back to Tadata with a success message

    Your account is now connected!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Tadata automatically handles token refresh. Your connection stays active without manual intervention.
</Check>

### API Key Connection

Some connectors use API key authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Find your API key in the service's settings (usually under Settings → API or Developer)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter API Key">
    Paste your API key into the Tadata connection form and configure any additional settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to complete the connection
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Tadata stores all credentials securely in an encrypted manner. You can always revoke access and permanently delete tokens through your dashboard.
</Info>

## Select Tools to Enable

After connecting, choose which tools to expose to your AI agents.

### Enable All (Recommended)

Enabling all tools is a great way to start. You get maximum flexibility and can discover useful operations you might not have known about.

Once your toolset is deployed, you can use **AI tool selection** in your server settings to automatically suggest the most relevant tools based on your desired use case. This helps your agent focus on the right operations without overwhelming it with options.

## Create New Toolset vs. Add to Existing

When connecting a connector, choose:

### Option 1: Create New Toolset

Best for:
- Your first connector
- Logically separate use cases (e.g., separate "Support Tools" from "DevOps Tools")
- Testing a connector before adding to production toolset

**Result:** New toolset at `{new-name}.mcp.tadata.com`

### Option 2: Add to Existing Toolset

Best for:
- Combining related services (e.g., Sentry + GitHub + Slack for triage)
- Building comprehensive workflows
- Following a [Recipe](/recipes/introduction)

**Result:** Tools added to existing toolset URL

## Best Practices

### Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use OAuth When Available" icon="shield-check">
    OAuth is more secure than API keys:
    - Tokens are scoped to specific permissions
    - Tokens can be revoked without changing passwords
    - Tadata handles token refresh automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Least Privilege" icon="lock">
    Only enable tools your agent actually needs:
    - Start with read-only tools
    - Add write operations carefully
    - Block destructive tools (delete, archive) by default
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Separate Accounts for Automation" icon="user-robot">
    Create dedicated service accounts for AI agents:
    - Easier to audit and track actions
    - Can be revoked without affecting human users
    - Clearer permission boundaries
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate API Keys Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    If using API keys (not OAuth):
    - Rotate keys every 90 days
    - Use restricted/scoped keys when possible
    - Monitor key usage in service dashboards
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Group Related Connectors" icon="layer-group">
    Combine connectors that work together:
    - **Triage**: Sentry + GitHub + Slack
    - **Support**: Linear + Intercom + Notion
    - **DevOps**: GitHub + Render + PagerDuty

    See [Recipes](/recipes/introduction) for pre-configured combinations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Toolset Names" icon="tag">
    Name toolsets clearly:
    - ✅ "Production Triage Agent"
    - ✅ "Customer Support Tools"
    - ❌ "My Toolset"
    - ❌ "Test 123"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Environments" icon="sitemap">
    Create different toolsets for:
    - Development (testing, staging APIs)
    - Production (live services)
    - Personal (individual use)

    Use [Server Groups](/getting-started/key-concepts#server-groups) to organize.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth authorization fails" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms**: Redirect fails, "Authorization denied" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Disable popup blockers
    - Try in an incognito/private window
    - Verify you have admin access to the workspace/organization
    - Check that the service is not experiencing an outage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API key connection fails" icon="key">
    **Symptoms**: "Invalid API key" or "Unauthorized" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Double-check the API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
    - Verify the key has not expired
    - Confirm the key has necessary permissions
    - Check the base URL is correct (for self-hosted services)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools not working after connection" icon="wrench">
    **Symptoms**: "Authentication failed" in Playground

    **Solutions**:
    - Check if token has expired (reconnect account)
    - Verify the connected account has access to requested resources
    - Confirm tool permissions are set to "Allow" not "Block"
    - Review error logs in Analytics for specific error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a connector I need" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Solutions**:
    - Search for alternative names (e.g., "Jira" vs "Atlassian Jira")
    - Check if the service has an official API
    - [Request a new connector](https://tadata.com/request-connector)
    - [Bring your own API](/guides/bringing-your-own) with OpenAPI spec
