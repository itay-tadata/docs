title: "Bring Your Own API"
description: "Add custom connectors with OpenAPI specs or integrate existing MCP servers"
---

## Overview

While Tadata offers many pre-built connectors, you can also bring your own APIs:
- **Internal/private APIs** not available in our catalog
- **Custom business logic** specific to your organization
- **Existing MCP servers** you've already built

This guide covers three approaches to bringing your own integrations.

## Approach 1: Upload OpenAPI Specification

**Best for:** REST APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Prerequisites

- OpenAPI 3.0+ specification file (JSON or YAML)
- Or a public URL hosting your OpenAPI spec
- API credentials (API key, OAuth client ID/secret, etc.)

### Step 1: Access Upload Interface

1. Navigate to **Toolsets** → **Create New**
2. Select **From OpenAPI Specification**
3. Choose upload method:
   - **Upload File**: Drag and drop your `.json` or `.yaml` file
   - **URL**: Enter the URL to your OpenAPI spec (e.g., `https://api.yourservice.com/openapi.json`)

<Tip>
  Many services host their OpenAPI specs at `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, or `/api-docs`. Check your API documentation.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Review Detected Tools

Tadata automatically parses your OpenAPI spec and generates tools from your API endpoints. You'll see:
- **Tool count**: Number of operations found
- **Authentication methods**: Detected from `securitySchemes`
- **Base URL**: API endpoint base URL
- **Tool list**: All generated tools with descriptions

Review the detected tools and their descriptions to ensure they match your API.

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

Choose your authentication method based on what your API supports:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Key (Header)">
    **Most common for internal APIs**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "header",
      "headerName": "Authorization",
      "headerPrefix": "Bearer ",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
    }
    ```

    **Examples:**
    - Authorization: `Bearer sk_live_abc123`
    - X-API-Key: `abc123`
    - X-Auth-Token: `token123`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API Key (Query Param)">
    **Less common, but some APIs use query parameters**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "query",
      "paramName": "api_key",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
    }
    ```

    **Example Request:**
    ```
    GET https://api.example.com/data?api_key=abc123
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    **For services supporting OAuth (more complex)**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "oauth",
      "clientId": "your-client-id",
      "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
      "authorizationUrl": "https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize",
      "tokenUrl": "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
      "scopes": ["read", "write"]
    }
    ```

    Tadata will handle the OAuth flow and token refresh.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Basic Auth">
    **Simple username/password authentication**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "basic",
      "username": "your-username",
      "password": "your-password"
    }
    ```

    Credentials are base64-encoded and sent in the `Authorization` header.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Custom Header Prefixes**: Some APIs require specific prefixes like `Token `, `Api-Key `, or no prefix at all. Check your API documentation.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Customize and Optimize (Optional)

You can customize tool definitions and apply Tadata's optimizations:

- **Edit tool names and descriptions**: Make them more intuitive for AI agents
- **Apply optimizations**: Enable response filtering, compression, and token reduction
- **Configure tool selection**: Use AI-powered tool selection for your use case

<Info>
  Learn more about optimization features in our [Optimization Guide](/optimization/overview) - including response compression, filtering, and knowledge indexing.
</Info>

### Step 5: Test in Playground

Test your tools in the Playground to verify they work correctly:

1. Click **Open Playground**
2. Test with sample requests
3. Verify responses and error handling

<Check>
  Once testing passes, your toolset is automatically deployed and ready to use!
</Check>

## Approach 2: Integrate Existing MCP Server

**Best for:** You've already built an MCP server and want to proxy it through Tadata for analytics and optimization

### Prerequisites

- Running MCP server with accessible endpoint (must be internet-accessible, not localhost)
- MCP server URL (HTTP or SSE transport)

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Toolsets** → **Create New**
2. Select **Integrate Existing MCP Server**
3. Enter your MCP server URL

**Authentication Handling:**

Tadata automatically detects and handles authentication:
- **OAuth with DCR**: Automatically configured if your server supports Dynamic Client Registration
- **OAuth without DCR**: You can provide OAuth client credentials (client ID, client secret, auth URLs)
- **Manual credentials**: If OAuth fails, provide authentication details (API key, headers, etc.)

4. Click **Test Connection** - Tadata verifies connectivity
5. Tadata fetches available tools from your server
6. Select which tools to expose
7. Your toolset is automatically deployed

### Benefits of Proxying

Even if you have a working MCP server, proxying through Tadata gives you:

- **Analytics**: Track tool usage, performance, errors
- **Optimization**: Enable compression, filtering, projection
- **Monitoring**: Get alerts on failures
- **Custom Domains**: Host on your own domain
- **Unified Management**: Manage all toolsets in one place

## Approach 3: Request Connector Addition

**Best for:** Popular APIs that aren't in our catalog yet

If you need a connector for a well-known service:

1. Visit [tadata.com/request-connector](https://tadata.com/request-connector)
2. Submit the service details:
   - Service name and website
   - API documentation link
   - Use case description
   - Expected usage volume
3. Our team will review and prioritize
4. We'll notify you when the connector is available

<Info>
  We prioritize connectors based on community demand. Upvote existing requests to increase priority!

## Best Practices

### OpenAPI Specs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use OpenAPI 3.0+">
    Older Swagger 2.0 specs work but may have limitations. Upgrade to OpenAPI 3.0+ for:
    - Better schema definitions
    - Improved authentication options
    - More detailed parameter validation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Detailed Descriptions">
    Write clear descriptions for operations:

    ✅ **Good**: "Create a new issue with title, description, and priority. Returns the created issue with ID and timestamp."

    ❌ **Bad**: "POST /issues"

    AI agents use descriptions to select the right tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define All Parameters">
    Include all parameters with:
    - Type (string, integer, boolean, etc.)
    - Required vs. optional
    - Default values
    - Enums for fixed choices
    - Examples

    This helps AI agents construct valid requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Your API">
    Use versioned URLs (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`) to avoid breaking changes. Update your OpenAPI spec URL when you deploy new versions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Scoped API Keys">
    Create API keys with minimal necessary permissions:
    - Read-only keys for read operations
    - Separate keys for development vs. production
    - Revokable keys for testing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Credentials Regularly">
    Set reminders to rotate API keys every 90 days. Tadata will notify you if authentication fails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Authentication Separately">
    Before testing tools, verify authentication:
    1. Use a simple read operation
    2. Confirm you get expected data (not 401/403 errors)
    3. Then test write operations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI upload fails to parse">
    **Symptoms**: "Invalid OpenAPI spec" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Validate your spec at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io)
    - Check for syntax errors (JSON/YAML formatting)
    - Ensure it's OpenAPI 3.0+ format
    - Remove unsupported extensions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools generated but authentication fails">
    **Symptoms**: "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden" in Playground

    **Solutions**:
    - Double-check API key is correct
    - Verify header name and prefix (e.g., "Bearer " with space)
    - Confirm the API key has necessary permissions
    - Test the API directly with curl/Postman first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools work in Playground but fail in agents">
    **Symptoms**: Tools execute in Playground but fail when used by Claude/Cursor

    **Solutions**:
    - Check MCP config syntax in Claude Desktop / Cursor
    - Verify the toolset URL is correct
    - Restart the AI application completely
    - Review error logs in Analytics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Existing MCP server connection fails">
    **Symptoms**: "Cannot connect to MCP server" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the server URL is accessible from internet (not localhost)
    - Check firewall rules allow Tadata IP ranges
    - Confirm transport type (HTTP vs. SSE) is correct
    - Test the MCP server directly with curl
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
