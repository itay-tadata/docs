title: "Bring Your Own API"
description: "Add custom connectors with OpenAPI specs or integrate existing MCP servers"
---

## Overview

While Tadata offers 50+ pre-built connectors, you may need to integrate:
- **Internal/private APIs** not available in our catalog
- **Custom business logic** specific to your organization
- **Existing MCP servers** you've already built

This guide covers three approaches to bringing your own APIs.

<Note>
  **Time Investment**: Expect 15-30 minutes for setup, including authentication configuration and testing. For instant setup, use [pre-built connectors](/guides/using-connectors).
</Note>

## When to Bring Your Own

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Pre-Built Connectors When" icon="plug">
    - Service is in our catalog (Linear, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
    - Standard OAuth or API key auth
    - Common use cases
    - Want instant setup
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bring Your Own When" icon="code">
    - Service not in catalog
    - Internal/private APIs
    - Custom authentication schemes
    - Existing MCP server to proxy
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Approach 1: Upload OpenAPI Specification

**Best for:** REST APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Prerequisites

- OpenAPI 3.0+ specification file (JSON or YAML)
- Or a public URL hosting your OpenAPI spec
- API credentials (API key, OAuth client ID/secret, etc.)

### Step 1: Access Upload Interface

1. Navigate to **Toolsets** → **Create New**
2. Select **From OpenAPI Specification**
3. Choose upload method:
   - **Upload File**: Drag and drop your `.json` or `.yaml` file
   - **URL**: Enter the URL to your OpenAPI spec (e.g., `https://api.yourservice.com/openapi.json`)

<Tip>
  Many services host their OpenAPI specs at `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, or `/api-docs`. Check your API documentation.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Review Generated Tools

Tadata automatically parses your OpenAPI spec and generates MCP tools:

```yaml Example: OpenAPI Endpoint
paths:
  /api/v1/issues:
    post:
      operationId: createIssue
      summary: Create a new issue
      parameters:
        - name: title
          in: body
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: priority
          in: body
          required: false
          schema:
            type: integer
```

**Becomes:**

```json Generated MCP Tool
{
  "name": "create_issue",
  "description": "Create a new issue",
  "parameters": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true
    },
    "priority": {
      "type": "integer",
      "required": false
    }
  }
}
```

You'll see:
- **Tool count**: Number of operations found
- **Authentication methods**: Detected from `securitySchemes`
- **Base URL**: API endpoint base URL
- **Tool list**: All generated tools with descriptions

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

Choose your authentication method based on what your API supports:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Key (Header)">
    **Most common for internal APIs**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "header",
      "headerName": "Authorization",
      "headerPrefix": "Bearer ",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
    }
    ```

    **Examples:**
    - Authorization: `Bearer sk_live_abc123`
    - X-API-Key: `abc123`
    - X-Auth-Token: `token123`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API Key (Query Param)">
    **Less common, but some APIs use query parameters**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "query",
      "paramName": "api_key",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
    }
    ```

    **Example Request:**
    ```
    GET https://api.example.com/data?api_key=abc123
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    **For services supporting OAuth (more complex)**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "oauth",
      "clientId": "your-client-id",
      "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
      "authorizationUrl": "https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize",
      "tokenUrl": "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
      "scopes": ["read", "write"]
    }
    ```

    Tadata will handle the OAuth flow and token refresh.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Basic Auth">
    **Simple username/password authentication**

    ```json Configuration
    {
      "authType": "basic",
      "username": "your-username",
      "password": "your-password"
    }
    ```

    Credentials are base64-encoded and sent in the `Authorization` header.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Custom Header Prefixes**: Some APIs require specific prefixes like `Token `, `Api-Key `, or no prefix at all. Check your API documentation.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Customize Tool Definitions (Optional)

You can edit generated tools:

- **Rename tools**: Make names more intuitive for AI agents
- **Edit descriptions**: Improve clarity for better tool selection
- **Hide parameters**: Remove unused or internal-only parameters
- **Add examples**: Provide example values to guide the AI

<CodeGroup>
```json Before
{
  "name": "post_api_v1_issues",
  "description": "POST /api/v1/issues"
}
```

```json After
{
  "name": "create_issue",
  "description": "Create a new issue with title, description, and priority. Returns the created issue ID."
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Better descriptions = better AI tool selection. Be specific about what each tool does and when to use it.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Test in Playground

Before deploying:

1. Click **Open Playground**
2. Test each tool with sample inputs
3. Verify responses are correct
4. Check error handling

Example tests:

```text Test Read Operations
List all issues
```

```text Test Write Operations
Create an issue titled "Test Issue" with priority 2
```

```text Test Error Handling
Create an issue without a title (should fail gracefully)
```

### Step 6: Deploy

Once testing passes:

1. Enter a **toolset name** (e.g., "Internal API Tools")
2. Click **Deploy**
3. Your toolset will be available at `{name}.mcp.tadata.com`

<Check>
  Your custom API is now usable by AI agents!
</Check>

## Approach 2: Integrate Existing MCP Server

**Best for:** You've already built an MCP server and want to proxy it through Tadata for analytics and optimization

### Prerequisites

- Running MCP server with accessible endpoint
- MCP server URL (HTTP or SSE transport)

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Toolsets** → **Create New**
2. Select **Integrate Existing MCP Server**
3. Enter your MCP server details:

```json Configuration
{
  "name": "My Custom MCP Server",
  "url": "https://my-mcp-server.com",
  "transport": "http",
  "authentication": {
    "type": "header",
    "headerName": "X-API-Key",
    "value": "your-server-key"
  }
}
```

4. Click **Test Connection**
5. Tadata will fetch available tools from your server
6. Select tools to expose
7. Deploy

### Benefits of Proxying

Even if you have a working MCP server, proxying through Tadata gives you:

- **Analytics**: Track tool usage, performance, errors
- **Optimization**: Enable compression, filtering, projection
- **Monitoring**: Get alerts on failures
- **Custom Domains**: Host on your own domain
- **Unified Management**: Manage all toolsets in one place

## Approach 3: Request Connector Addition

**Best for:** Popular APIs that aren't in our catalog yet

If you need a connector for a well-known service:

1. Visit [tadata.com/request-connector](https://tadata.com/request-connector)
2. Submit the service details:
   - Service name and website
   - API documentation link
   - Use case description
   - Expected usage volume
3. Our team will review and prioritize
4. We'll notify you when the connector is available

<Info>
  We prioritize connectors based on community demand. Upvote existing requests to increase priority!

## Best Practices

### OpenAPI Specs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use OpenAPI 3.0+">
    Older Swagger 2.0 specs work but may have limitations. Upgrade to OpenAPI 3.0+ for:
    - Better schema definitions
    - Improved authentication options
    - More detailed parameter validation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Detailed Descriptions">
    Write clear descriptions for operations:

    ✅ **Good**: "Create a new issue with title, description, and priority. Returns the created issue with ID and timestamp."

    ❌ **Bad**: "POST /issues"

    AI agents use descriptions to select the right tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define All Parameters">
    Include all parameters with:
    - Type (string, integer, boolean, etc.)
    - Required vs. optional
    - Default values
    - Enums for fixed choices
    - Examples

    This helps AI agents construct valid requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Your API">
    Use versioned URLs (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`) to avoid breaking changes. Update your OpenAPI spec URL when you deploy new versions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Scoped API Keys">
    Create API keys with minimal necessary permissions:
    - Read-only keys for read operations
    - Separate keys for development vs. production
    - Revokable keys for testing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Credentials Regularly">
    Set reminders to rotate API keys every 90 days. Tadata will notify you if authentication fails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Authentication Separately">
    Before testing tools, verify authentication:
    1. Use a simple read operation
    2. Confirm you get expected data (not 401/403 errors)
    3. Then test write operations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test All Tool Types">
    Categorize and test:
    - **Read operations** (GET): Should return data
    - **Write operations** (POST, PUT): Should create/update resources
    - **Delete operations**: Test carefully with test data only
    - **List operations**: Verify pagination works
    - **Search operations**: Test various query parameters
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Errors Gracefully">
    Test error scenarios:
    - Missing required parameters
    - Invalid parameter values
    - Authentication failures
    - Rate limiting (if applicable)
    - Service downtime

    Verify error messages are clear and actionable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Response Optimization">
    Review responses in Playground:
    - Are responses too large?
    - Can you filter specific fields?
    - Should you enable compression?

    See [Optimization](/optimization/overview) for advanced techniques.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI upload fails to parse">
    **Symptoms**: "Invalid OpenAPI spec" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Validate your spec at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io)
    - Check for syntax errors (JSON/YAML formatting)
    - Ensure it's OpenAPI 3.0+ format
    - Remove unsupported extensions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools generated but authentication fails">
    **Symptoms**: "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden" in Playground

    **Solutions**:
    - Double-check API key is correct
    - Verify header name and prefix (e.g., "Bearer " with space)
    - Confirm the API key has necessary permissions
    - Test the API directly with curl/Postman first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools work in Playground but fail in agents">
    **Symptoms**: Tools execute in Playground but fail when used by Claude/Cursor

    **Solutions**:
    - Check MCP config syntax in Claude Desktop / Cursor
    - Verify the toolset URL is correct
    - Restart the AI application completely
    - Review error logs in Analytics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Existing MCP server connection fails">
    **Symptoms**: "Cannot connect to MCP server" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the server URL is accessible from internet (not localhost)
    - Check firewall rules allow Tadata IP ranges
    - Confirm transport type (HTTP vs. SSE) is correct
    - Test the MCP server directly with curl
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
