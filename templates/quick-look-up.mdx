Before messaging someone you haven't talked to in a while or jumping on a call, you probably open LinkedIn, Twitter, maybe Google to see what's new with them and their company.

This agent replaces that whole routine. Type a name, and it scans their socials and the web to surface what's relevant.

## Example prompt

```text Quick Look-Up Prompt expandable
Given a person's name and their company name, generate a short update about what's new with them in the past week.

Figure out their social media handles (it might not be their name).

Then use Apify to check their recent Twitter posts, Tavily to check their recent LinkedIn posts and any press releases / blogs / news from their company.

In the report, include the links to the posts and articles you find.
```
