title: "Triage Agent"
description: "Automatically investigate and resolve production incidents"
---

## Overview

The **Triage Agent** automatically detects, investigates, and helps resolve production issues by connecting error monitoring, code repositories, team communication, and deployment tools.

<Check>
  **Result:** Reduce triage time from 30 minutes to 3 minutes
</Check>

## Problem It Solves

When a production error occurs:
1. ❌ Someone has to notice (Sentry alert)
2. ❌ Investigate error (read stack trace, check logs)
3. ❌ Find relevant code (search GitHub)
4. ❌ Notify team (post to Slack)
5. ❌ Create ticket (open Linear issue)
6. ❌ Check if related to recent deploy (Render logs)

**Total time: 20-40 minutes** of manual work

## Solution: Automated Triage

✅ **Agent does all of this automatically in < 3 minutes**

### Alternative Connectors

Don't use these exact tools? Use alternatives:

| Recommended | Alternative Options |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Sentry | Rollbar, Bugsnag, Datadog APM |
| GitHub | GitLab, Bitbucket |
| Slack | Discord, Microsoft Teams |
| Render | Vercel, Railway, Heroku, AWS |

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Services">
    - **Sentry** (OAuth): Select organization and project
    - **GitHub** (API Key): Enter GitHub token
    - **Slack** (OAuth): Select workspace and default channel
    - **Render** (API Key): Enter Render API key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click Deploy to activate your Triage Agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

**Example prompts:**
- "Check Sentry for new production errors and investigate"
- "Is the recent error spike related to our latest deployment?"
- "Investigate Sentry error SENTRY-ABC-123"

## Key Features

- **Error Detection**: Monitor production errors from Sentry
- **Code Investigation**: Search GitHub for relevant code
- **Team Notification**: Alert team in Slack
- **Deployment Tracking**: Check recent Render deployments

## Best Practices

- **Filter Sentry Errors**: Configure Sentry to only alert on actionable errors (exclude known/expected errors, filter by environment)
- **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: Good commit messages help correlate errors with code changes
- **Require Approval for Rollbacks**: Keep destructive actions like `rollback_deployment` as "Require Approval" for safety
