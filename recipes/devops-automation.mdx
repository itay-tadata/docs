## Example Workflows

### Auto-Deploy Workflow

```text
1. Check for merged PRs: list_pull_requests (status: merged)
2. If merged and CI passed: trigger_deploy to staging
3. Monitor Sentry for 10 minutes
4. If error rate < 1%: trigger_deploy to production
5. If error rate > 5%: rollback and create_incident in PagerDuty
```

### Incident Response Workflow

```text
Critical error detected:
1. list_errors from Sentry
2. Check recent deployments: list_deployments
3. If error spike after deploy: suggest rollback
4. create_incident in PagerDuty
5. Page on-call engineer: list_on_call
```
