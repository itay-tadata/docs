## What Are Recipes?

**Recipes** are pre-designed combinations of connectors that solve specific use cases. Instead of figuring out which connectors to combine and how to configure them, use a recipe to get started instantly.

<Info>
  Think of recipes as "templates" or "blueprints" for building powerful AI agents.

## Recipe Components

Each recipe includes:

### Connectors

List of pre-built integrations to connect:
- Which services (Linear, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Why each is needed
- Alternative options (e.g., Jira instead of Linear)

### Tools

Specific tools enabled from each connector:
- Read operations (safe, always enabled)
- Write operations (carefully selected)
- Blocked tools (dangerous operations disabled by default)

### Configuration

Recommended settings:
- Tool permissions (allow, block, require approval)
- Optimization features (knowledge indexing, code indexing)
- Workflows (multi-tool automation sequences)

### Example Workflows

Real-world scenarios showing the agent in action:
- Step-by-step tool execution
- Expected outcomes
- Common edge cases

## Customizing Recipes

Recipes are starting points. Customize them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add More Connectors" icon="plus">
    Expand the recipe with additional services:
    - Triage Agent + PagerDuty for alerting
    - Support Agent + Salesforce for CRM
    - DevOps Agent + DataDog for monitoring
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remove Connectors" icon="minus">
    Don't need all connectors? Remove unused ones:
    - Triage Agent without Slack (if you use Discord)
    - Support Agent without Intercom (if you use Zendesk)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust Tool Permissions" icon="lock">
    Change which tools are allowed:
    - Block destructive operations (delete, archive)
    - Require approval for sensitive actions (deploy, merge PR)
    - Enable additional tools as you gain confidence
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Knowledge/Code Indexing" icon="book">
    Enhance with search capabilities:
    - Add company documentation (knowledge indexing)
    - Add code repositories (code indexing)
    - Agents can reference docs and code automatically
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with One Recipe" icon="flag-checkered">
    Don't try to implement all recipes at once:
    1. Choose your biggest pain point
    2. Implement one recipe
    3. Test thoroughly
    4. Roll out to team
    5. Then add more recipes

    **Gradual adoption = higher success rate**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test in Playground First" icon="flask">
    Before deploying to production:
    1. Test each tool individually
    2. Test multi-tool workflows
    3. Test error handling
    4. Verify tool permissions

    **Catch issues early in safe environment**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Test Accounts" icon="vial">
    Connect test workspaces first:
    - Linear: Test workspace
    - Slack: Test channel (#testing)
    - GitHub: Test repository

    Validate without affecting production.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    After deploying:
    - Track tool usage
    - Monitor error rates
    - Review execution traces
    - Optimize based on data

    **Data-driven iteration**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share with Team" icon="users">
    Document your configuration:
    - Which recipe you're using
    - Customizations made
    - Example workflows
    - Contact for questions

    **Enable team adoption**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Your Own Recipe

Have a unique workflow? Create a custom recipe:

1. **Identify Use Case**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Select Connectors**: Which services do you need?
3. **Configure Tools**: Enable relevant operations
4. **Test Workflows**: Verify multi-tool sequences work
5. **Document**: Write down the workflow steps
6. **Share**: Export configuration, share with team
