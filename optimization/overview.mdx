## Why Optimization Matters

AI agents face key challenges when using tools:

1. **Token Limits**: Large API responses consume context windows fast
2. **Latency**: Slow API calls frustrate users
3. **Tool Selection**: Too many tools overwhelm agents

Tadata's connectors come with built-in optimizations that solve these problems automatically.

## Optimization Features

### 1. Response Compression

**Achieves 60%+ token savings**

API responses typically include hundreds of fields that AI agents don't need. Tadata compresses responses to only essential data.

**Result:** More context window space for your agent's conversation and reasoning.

  **Built into all pre-built connectors.** No configuration needed.

### 2. Response Projection

**Returns only relevant fields for each operation**

Instead of returning entire objects with nested arrays and unnecessary metadata, Tadata projects responses to include only what matters for the task.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces token count significantly
- Keeps agents focused on relevant information
- Cleaner data that's easier to understand and process

**Result:** Agents work with exactly the data they need, nothing more.

### 3. Response Filtering

**Optimizes tools that return complex query results**

Especially relevant for database queries and data-intensive operations, response filtering removes unnecessary data to improve performance.

**Benefits:**
- Faster API calls
- Better user experience
- Lower token consumption
- Critical for complex database queries

**Result:** Agents respond faster, users wait less.

### 4. Tool Batching

**Reduces runtime drastically by parallelizing operations**

AI agents can't parallelize tool calls on their own. Tool batching executes related operations in parallel, dramatically improving performance.

**Benefits:**
- Parallel execution of related operations
- Drastically reduced runtime
- Fewer sequential bottlenecks

**Result:** Complex workflows complete much faster.

### 5. Tool Workflows

**Pre-defined workflows reduce runtime by up to 80%**

While agents can figure out what to do at runtime, many workflows are common and predictable. Defining these workflows upfront eliminates the planning overhead and executes them optimally.

**Example Workflows:**
- **Triage**: Fetch error → Search code → Create issue → Notify team
- **Deploy**: Merge PR → Deploy → Monitor → Rollback if errors
- **Support**: Ticket received → Search docs → Auto-respond → Escalate if needed

**Benefits:**
- Up to 80% runtime reduction
- No planning overhead - workflows execute immediately
- Consistent execution every time
- Graceful error handling

**Result:** Common workflows complete in seconds instead of requiring agent reasoning at each step.

### 6. Suggested Tool Names & Descriptions

**AI-optimized tool naming for better selection**

Generic API endpoint names like `POST /issues` don't help AI agents understand what a tool does. Tadata optimizes tool names and descriptions to be intuitive.

**Before:**
- Tool: `POST /api/v1/issues`
- Description: "Creates a new issue resource"

**After:**
- Tool: `create_linear_issue`
- Description: "Create a new issue in Linear with title, description, priority, and assignee"

**Benefits:**
- Agents choose the right tool more often
- Reduced confusion and errors
- Better alignment with natural language requests

**Result:** AI agents understand and use your tools correctly.

### 7. Automated Tool Selection

**Focus agents on relevant operations only**

When you have toolsets with many connectors, automated tool selection suggests only the tools relevant for specific use cases.

**How It Works:**
- You enable all tools in a connector (maximum flexibility)
- Configure use-case-based tool selection in server settings
- Agents only see tools relevant to their task

**Example:**
For a "production triage" agent:
- ✅ Show: Error monitoring, code search, issue creation
- ❌ Hide: Marketing tools, CRM operations, analytics

**Benefits:**
- Agents aren't overwhelmed by irrelevant options
- Better tool selection accuracy
- Faster decision-making

**Result:** Your agents focus on what matters for their specific role.

## How Tadata Handles Optimizations

<Info>
  **Pre-Built Connectors:** Tadata takes care of all optimizations automatically. No configuration needed.

  **Custom Toolsets:** You can enable and configure these optimizations for your own APIs and connectors.
</Info>

### Automatic (All Pre-Built Connectors)

These optimizations are **always enabled** for Tadata's pre-built connectors:

✅ Response Compression
✅ Response Projection
✅ Response Filtering

**No configuration needed.** Just connect and go.

### Optional (Configure for Custom Toolsets)

These features are available when bringing your own APIs or creating custom toolsets:

⚙️ Tool Batching
⚙️ Tool Workflows
⚙️ Suggested Tool Names & Descriptions
⚙️ Automated Tool Selection

**Tadata lets you add these optimizations to your custom connectors.**

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Pre-Built Connectors" icon="plug">
    Pre-built connectors have all automatic optimizations built-in. No work needed.

    Only build custom connectors when the service you need isn't available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable All Tools, Use Automated Selection" icon="sparkles">
    Don't limit yourself by enabling only some tools. Instead:
    1. Enable all tools in a connector
    2. Use automated tool selection to show relevant ones per use case
    3. Get maximum flexibility with focused agent experience
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Workflows for Repetitive Tasks" icon="arrows-repeat">
    If your agent frequently performs multi-step sequences:
    1. Define a workflow once
    2. Reuse across all agent instances
    3. Benefit from consistent execution and error handling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optimize Tool Names for Your Use Case" icon="tag">
    Generic API names don't help AI agents. Customize tool names and descriptions to match:
    - How users naturally describe tasks
    - Your team's terminology
    - Common use cases

    Example: Change "POST /deployments" to "Deploy code to production environment"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Performance in Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    Track which optimizations have the biggest impact:
    - Token usage before/after
    - Response time improvements
    - Tool selection accuracy

    Use this data to fine-tune configurations.
