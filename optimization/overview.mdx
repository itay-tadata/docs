## Why Optimization Matters

AI agents face two key challenges when using tools:

1. **Token Limits**: Large API responses quickly consume context windows
2. **Latency**: Slow API calls frustrate users and waste time

Tadata's pre-built connectors are **already optimized** to address these issues. No configuration needed - they just work efficiently.

## Built-In Optimizations

### Pre-Optimized Responses

Our connectors return only what's needed:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linear Example">
    **Without Optimization:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ABC-123",
      "title": "Fix bug",
      "description": "...",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "priority": 2,
      "createdAt": "2025-11-29T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-29T12:00:00Z",
      "creator": {...},  // 50+ fields
      "assignee": {...},  // 50+ fields
      "project": {...},  // 50+ fields
      "team": {...},  // 50+ fields
      "comments": [...],  // Array of comments
      "attachments": [...],  // Array of attachments
      "relations": [...],  // Array of related issues
      // 100+ more fields...
    }
    ```

    **Response size:** ~15 KB per issue

    **With Tadata Optimization:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ABC-123",
      "title": "Fix bug",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "priority": 2,
      "assignee": "Alice",
      "url": "https://linear.app/..."
    }
    ```

    **Response size:** ~200 bytes per issue

    **Savings:** 98.7% reduction
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub Example">
    **Without Optimization:**
    Full PR object with 200+ fields including commit history, diffs, reviews, comments, etc.

    **With Tadata Optimization:**
    ```json
    {
      "number": 123,
      "title": "Add feature",
      "state": "open",
      "author": "bob",
      "url": "https://github.com/..."
    }
    ```

    **Savings:** 95%+ reduction
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
  **No configuration required.** This optimization is built into every Tadata connector.

## Advanced Optimization Features

### 1. Analytics & Monitoring

Track tool performance and usage:

- **Tool Execution Metrics**: Calls, errors, response times
- **Usage Patterns**: Which tools are most used, by which clients
- **Traces**: Detailed logs of every tool invocation
- **Export**: Download data for external analysis

  Monitor usage, performance, and costs
</Card>

### 2. Knowledge Indexing

Enable `search-docs` tool for documentation search:

- Index markdown/documentation repositories
- AI agents query docs without reading everything
- Avoid hitting token limits with full doc embedding

**Use Cases:**
- Product documentation search
- Internal wiki/knowledge base access
- API reference lookup

<Card title="Knowledge Indexing" icon="book" href="/optimization/knowledge-indexing">
  Enable documentation search for your toolsets
</Card>

### 3. Code Indexing

Enable `search-code` tool for repository search:

- Index code repositories (GitHub, GitLab)
- Find functions, classes, patterns
- Support debugging and code review workflows

**Use Cases:**
- Code search for debugging
- Finding similar patterns
- Reference existing implementations

</Card>

### 4. Workflows

Automate multi-tool sequences (part of optimization):

- Chain multiple tool calls
- Conditional logic
- Error handling
- Reusable patterns

**Use Cases:**
- Triage: Check Sentry → Find code → Create issue → Notify team
- Deploy: Merge PR → Deploy → Monitor errors → Rollback if needed

<Info>
  Workflows are available in toolset configuration under Optimization settings.
</Info>

## Optimization Comparison

| Feature | Pre-Built Connectors | Custom APIs (OpenAPI) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Token-Efficient Responses** | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Manual configuration |
| **Fast Execution** | ✅ Optimized endpoints | ⚠️ Depends on API |
| **Analytics** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Knowledge Indexing** | ✅ Available | ✅ Available |
| **Code Indexing** | ✅ Available | ✅ Available |
| **Workflows** | ✅ Available | ✅ Available |

<Tip>
  **Recommendation:** Use pre-built connectors whenever possible to get optimizations automatically.
</Tip>

## Measuring Impact

### Token Savings

View token savings in Analytics:

```
Tool: list_issues
Executions: 1,000
Avg tokens without optimization: 5,000
Avg tokens with optimization: 250
Total tokens saved: 4,750,000 (95% reduction)
```

### Performance Improvements

Compare response times:

| Tool | Without Optimization | With Optimization | Improvement |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `list_issues` | 2.5s | 450ms | 82% faster |
| `search_docs` | N/A (load all docs) | 200ms | ∞ (not possible without) |
| `create_issue` | 1.2s | 800ms | 33% faster |

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Start with Pre-Built Connectors" icon="plug">
    Pre-built connectors are already optimized. No work needed on your part.

    Only build custom connectors when necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Analytics Early" icon="chart-line">
    Turn on analytics from day one to:
    - Identify slow tools
    - Find optimization opportunities
    - Track usage patterns
    - Prove ROI
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Knowledge Indexing for Large Docs" icon="book">
    If your product has extensive documentation:
    - Enable `search-docs` tool
    - Index markdown files
    - Let AI agents search instead of loading all docs

    Saves massive amounts of tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Code Indexing for Development Workflows" icon="code">
    For agents working with code:
    - Enable `search-code` tool
    - Index relevant repositories
    - Agents can find functions without reading entire codebases
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor and Iterate" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Regularly review analytics:
    - Which tools are slowest?
    - Which use the most tokens?
    - Are there errors to fix?

    Continuous improvement based on data.
