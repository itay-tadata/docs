## Overview

The Analytics dashboard shows you how your toolsets are being used, helping you understand usage patterns and identify issues.

## What You Can See

### Usage Metrics

- **Total tool calls** - How many times tools have been executed
- **Calls per tool** - Which tools are used most frequently
- **Client breakdown** - Which AI agents are using your toolsets (Claude Desktop, Cursor, custom clients)
- **Usage over time** - Trends and patterns in tool execution

### Performance

- **Response times** - How long tools take to execute
- **Error rates** - Which tools are failing and why
- **Success rates** - Percentage of successful executions per tool

### Execution Traces

Detailed logs of every tool call including:
- Input parameters sent by the agent
- Output returned by the tool
- Error messages if the call failed
- Timestamp and duration
- Which client made the request

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Debug Failing Tools" icon="wrench">
    When tools are failing, review error traces to see:
    - What error messages are returned
    - Which parameters caused failures
    - Authentication issues

    Fix the root cause and verify error rates decrease.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identify Slow Tools" icon="gauge">
    Find tools with high response times and optimize them:
    - Enable response filtering
    - Configure pagination
    - Contact support for optimization help
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Understand Usage Patterns" icon="chart-line">
    See which tools are most valuable:
    - High usage indicates important workflows
    - Client distribution shows adoption
    - Usage trends correlate with business events

    Use this data to prioritize which connectors to add or improve.
  </Accordion>
