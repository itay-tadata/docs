title: "Passthrough Authentication"
description: "Advanced authentication mode where AI agent provides credentials directly"
---

## Overview

**Passthrough authentication** is an advanced mode where your AI agent sends credentials with each request instead of Tadata storing them. This gives you full control over credential management but comes with limitations.

<Warning>
  **Most users don't need passthrough.** The standard authentication model (Tadata stores credentials) is simpler and supports multi-source toolsets.

  Only use passthrough if you have specific requirements around credential storage or OAuth app ownership.
</Warning>

## How Passthrough Works

### Standard Authentication (Default)
```
AI Agent → Tadata (has stored credentials) → Services (Linear, Slack, GitHub)
```

### Passthrough Authentication
```
AI Agent (has credentials) → Tadata (passes through) → Service (single source only)
```

In passthrough mode:
1. AI agent obtains credentials (OAuth token or API key)
2. AI agent sends credentials with each tool execution request
3. Tadata passes credentials through to the service without storing
4. Service validates and responds

## Key Limitation

<Warning>
  **Passthrough toolsets are limited to ONE connector (one API source).**

  You cannot mix multiple sources in a passthrough toolset. For example:
  - ❌ Slack + Linear + GitHub (requires standard auth)
  - ✅ Just Linear (passthrough works)
  - ✅ Just your custom API (passthrough works)

  For multi-source workflows, use standard authentication.
</Warning>

## OAuth Passthrough

### Requirements

To use OAuth passthrough, you must:
- **Control the OAuth resource** - Have your own OAuth app registered with the service
- **Handle OAuth flow** - Your AI agent must implement the OAuth authorization code flow
- **Manage tokens** - Your agent handles token refresh and expiration

### When to Use

Use OAuth passthrough if:
- You've already built your own OAuth app and want to use it
- You need custom OAuth scopes not provided by Tadata's OAuth apps
- You want OAuth tokens to never leave your control
- You're integrating a single-source toolset only

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register OAuth App">
    Register your OAuth application with the service (Linear, GitHub, etc.)
    - Set redirect URI to your agent's callback handler
    - Note client ID and client secret
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Toolset">
    In Tadata, create a toolset and enable passthrough mode:
    - Select the connector (e.g., Linear)
    - Choose **Passthrough Authentication**
    - Select **OAuth** as passthrough type
    - Provide OAuth configuration (authorization URL, token URL, scopes)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement OAuth in Agent">
    Your AI agent must:
    - Redirect users to authorization URL
    - Handle callback with authorization code
    - Exchange code for access + refresh tokens
    - Store tokens securely
    - Send access token with each tool request to Tadata
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Tokens with Requests">
    When executing tools, include OAuth token in request headers:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Token Format

Tadata expects OAuth tokens in the `Authorization` header:

```http
POST https://your-toolset.mcp.tadata.com/execute
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tool": "create_issue",
  "parameters": { ... }
}
```

## API Key Passthrough

### Requirements

No special requirements. The AI agent just needs the API key.

### When to Use

Use API key passthrough if:
- You don't want Tadata to store API keys
- You need different API keys per user/agent
- You want full control over key rotation
- You're integrating a single-source toolset only

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Retrieve API key from the service or generate one for your custom API
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Toolset">
    In Tadata, create a toolset and enable passthrough mode:
    - Select the connector or bring your own API
    - Choose **Passthrough Authentication**
    - Select **API Key** as passthrough type
    - Specify header name (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-API-Key`)
    - Specify header prefix (e.g., `Bearer `, `Token `, or none)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Key in Agent">
    Your AI agent stores the API key securely (environment variable, secrets manager, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Key with Requests">
    When executing tools, include API key in request headers as configured
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Key Format

Tadata expects API keys in the configured header. Examples:

**Bearer Token:**
```http
POST https://your-toolset.mcp.tadata.com/execute
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123xyz789
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Custom Header:**
```http
POST https://your-toolset.mcp.tadata.com/execute
X-API-Key: abc123xyz789
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Transmission" icon="shield">
    In passthrough mode, credentials are sent with every request:
    - All communication is over HTTPS (required)
    - Credentials are not logged by Tadata
    - Credentials are passed directly to the target service

    Ensure your AI agent also stores credentials securely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token Refresh" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **You are responsible for token refresh.**

    For OAuth passthrough:
    - Monitor access token expiration
    - Implement refresh token flow
    - Handle refresh failures gracefully

    Standard authentication handles this automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
    Each request includes credentials, so rate limiting applies per credential:
    - Multiple agents using the same API key share rate limits
    - Consider using separate API keys per agent if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audit Trails" icon="eye">
    Actions appear under the credential owner:
    - OAuth: Actions appear under the user who authorized
    - API Key: Actions appear under the API key owner/service account

    Use service accounts for clearer audit trails.
  </Accordion>

## Comparison: Standard vs. Passthrough

| Feature | Standard (Tadata stores) | Passthrough |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Multi-source toolsets** | ✅ Yes (Slack + Linear + GitHub) | ❌ No (one connector only) |
| **Setup complexity** | ✅ Simple (click Connect) | ⚠️ Complex (implement OAuth/manage keys) |
| **Credential storage** | Tadata (encrypted) | AI agent (you manage) |
| **Token refresh** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual (you handle) |
| **OAuth app** | Tadata's OAuth apps | Your OAuth app (required for OAuth) |
| **Per-user credentials** | ✅ Yes (connect per user) | ✅ Yes (agent manages) |
| **Use case** | Most toolsets, multi-source workflows | Advanced, single-source, full control |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized in passthrough mode" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:** Tools fail with 401 despite providing credentials

    **Causes:**
    - Credential format incorrect (missing prefix, wrong header)
    - OAuth token expired (you need to refresh)
    - API key invalid or revoked

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify credential format matches configuration
    - Check token expiration and refresh if needed
    - Test credentials directly against service API (curl/Postman)
    - Review Tadata passthrough configuration (header name, prefix)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot mix connectors in passthrough toolset" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms:** Error when trying to add multiple connectors to passthrough toolset

    **Cause:** Passthrough mode only supports single-source toolsets

    **Solution:** Use standard authentication (Tadata stores credentials) for multi-source toolsets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OAuth refresh not working" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Symptoms:** Access tokens expire and tools fail

    **Cause:** In passthrough mode, you are responsible for token refresh

    **Solution:**
    - Implement refresh token flow in your AI agent
    - Monitor token expiration and refresh proactively
    - Or switch to standard authentication for automatic refresh
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Different credentials per user" icon="users">
    **Question:** How do I use different credentials for different users?

    **Answer:**
    In passthrough mode, each agent instance can send different credentials. Your agent should:
    1. Store credentials per user
    2. Include the appropriate user's credentials with each request
    3. Ensure proper isolation and security

    Alternatively, use standard authentication and have each user connect their own account in Tadata.
