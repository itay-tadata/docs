## How Authentication Works

When you connect services to Tadata, we store your credentials securely. Your AI agent authenticates with Tadata once, and Tadata handles authentication with all connected services on your behalf.

### The Flow

1. **You connect services** (Linear, GitHub, Slack, etc.) to Tadata
2. **Tadata stores credentials** - OAuth tokens or API keys, encrypted at rest
3. **Your AI agent connects to Tadata** - Authenticates once with your Tadata toolset
4. **Tadata authenticates with services** - Transparently handles auth when tools execute

This means you can create toolsets from multiple sources without managing separate credentials for each one.

## Connecting Services

### OAuth (Most Common)

For services with OAuth support, click **Connect** and authorize:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect">
    Find your service (Slack, Linear, GitHub) and click **Connect**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize">
    Redirected to the service to review and grant permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    Tadata stores OAuth tokens (access + refresh) securely. Automatic token refresh handled for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Keys

For services without OAuth or custom APIs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Retrieve API key from service settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure in Tadata">
    Enter the API key in Tadata's connector configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    Tadata stores the key securely and uses it when executing tools
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Storage" icon="lock">
    All credentials (OAuth tokens and API keys) are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256).

    Only Tadata's backend services can decrypt credentials when needed for API calls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic Token Refresh" icon="arrows-rotate">
    For OAuth connections, Tadata automatically refreshes expired access tokens using refresh tokens.

    You never have to manually refresh tokens or reconnect services.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revocation" icon="trash">
    Revoke access anytime:
    - In Tadata: Disconnect the service
    - In the service: Revoke Tadata OAuth app
    - Tadata stores credentials securely in an encrypted manner, and you can always revoke access and permanently delete tokens through your dashboard

    All credentials are permanently deleted upon revocation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTTPS Only" icon="shield">
    All communication is over HTTPS. Credentials are never logged or exposed in URLs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use OAuth When Available" icon="shield-check">
    OAuth is more secure than API keys:
    - Scoped permissions (read vs. write, specific resources)
    - Revocable without changing passwords
    - Automatic token refresh

    Prefer OAuth-enabled connectors over API key connectors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Least Privilege" icon="user-shield">
    Grant minimum necessary permissions:
    - OAuth: Select only required scopes during authorization
    - API Keys: Create restricted/scoped keys when possible

    If you only read data, don't grant write permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Service Accounts for Production" icon="robot">
    Create dedicated bot accounts for AI agents:
    - Not tied to any individual (survives team changes)
    - Clear audit trails (all actions under bot name)
    - Controlled permissions (grant only what the bot needs)

    Example: Create `ai-agent-bot@company.com` in Linear, GitHub, Slack.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Connected Services" icon="eye">
    Periodically review connected services in Tadata:
    - Disconnect unused services
    - Verify permissions are still appropriate
    - Check for expired or failing connections

    Fewer connections = smaller attack surface.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth authorization fails" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms:** Redirect fails or "Authorization denied" error

    **Solutions:**
    - Disable popup blockers for Tadata
    - Try in incognito/private browser
    - Verify you have admin access to the workspace/organization
    - Check if service is experiencing an outage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools fail with 401 Unauthorized" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:** Tools work initially, then fail with 401

    **Causes:**
    - OAuth token expired (auto-refresh failed)
    - API key was revoked or expired
    - Tadata app was revoked in service settings

    **Solutions:**
    - Check connection status in Tadata dashboard
    - Reconnect the service if needed
    - Verify credentials are still valid
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools fail with 403 Forbidden" icon="lock">
    **Symptoms:** Some tools work, others fail with 403

    **Causes:**
    - Insufficient OAuth scopes
    - API key lacks necessary permissions
    - Resource is private/inaccessible to connected account

    **Solutions:**
    - Review OAuth scopes granted during authorization
    - Reconnect with broader scopes if needed
    - Check API key permissions in service dashboard
    - Verify connected account has access to the resource
