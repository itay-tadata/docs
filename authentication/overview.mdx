## Why Authentication Matters

AI agents need to authenticate with services (Linear, GitHub, Slack, etc.) to perform actions on your behalf. Tadata provides two authentication approaches, each with different trade-offs.

## Two Approaches

    Managed authentication with automatic token refresh
  </Card>
  <Card title="Passthrough" icon="key" href="/authentication/passthrough">
    Direct API key pass-through for custom APIs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparison

| Feature | OAuth | Passthrough |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Setup** | One-click "Connect" button | Manual API key configuration |
| **Security** | ✅ Best: Tokens scoped, encrypted, auto-refresh | ⚠️ Good: Keys transmitted over HTTPS only |
| **Token Storage** | Tadata stores encrypted tokens | Tadata does NOT store keys |
| **Token Refresh** | Automatic | Manual (you handle expiration) |
| **Revocation** | Easy: Revoke in service dashboard | Manual: Regenerate API key |
| **Best For** | Pre-built connectors (Linear, GitHub, Slack) | Custom APIs, internal tools, simple integrations |
| **User Experience** | Seamless | Requires finding/copying API key |

## OAuth (Managed Authentication)

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Clicks Connect">
    In Tadata, user clicks "Connect Linear" (or any OAuth-enabled connector)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect to Service">
    User is redirected to Linear's authorization page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    User reviews requested permissions (read issues, write issues, etc.) and clicks "Authorize"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect Back">
    Linear redirects back to Tadata with an authorization code
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exchange for Tokens">
    Tadata exchanges the code for access token + refresh token

    - **Access Token**: Short-lived (hours/days), used for API calls
    - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (months/years), used to get new access tokens
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Tokens are encrypted and stored in Tadata's secure vault
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scoped Permissions" icon="lock">
    OAuth tokens are scoped to specific permissions:
    - Linear: `read:issues`, `write:issues`, `read:projects`
    - GitHub: `repo`, `read:user`, `write:discussion`
    - Slack: `chat:write`, `channels:read`

    This limits what the AI agent can do, even if compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic Token Refresh" icon="arrows-rotate">
    When an access token expires, Tadata automatically:
    1. Detects the expiration (401 Unauthorized response)
    2. Uses the refresh token to get a new access token
    3. Retries the original request
    4. Updates stored tokens

    **You never have to manually refresh tokens.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Easy Revocation" icon="trash">
    Revoke access anytime:
    - In Tadata: Settings → Connected Accounts → Disconnect
    - In service dashboard: Revoke Tadata OAuth app

    No need to rotate API keys or update configurations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User-Specific Access" icon="user">
    Each user connects their own account. Actions appear under their name in the service (e.g., "Alice created issue ABC-123" in Linear).

    Better audit trails and accountability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When to Use OAuth

✅ **Use OAuth when:**
- Service supports it (Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.)
- You want automatic token management
- You need user-specific actions (audit trails)
- You're using pre-built Tadata connectors

❌ **Don't use OAuth when:**
- Service doesn't support OAuth
- You need a service account (not user-specific)
- You're integrating internal/custom APIs

</Card>

## Passthrough Authentication

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    User retrieves API key from service settings (e.g., Sentry → Settings → API Keys)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure in Tadata">
    User enters API key in Tadata with header/query parameter configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Calls">
    When a tool is executed:
    1. Tadata receives the request from AI agent
    2. Tadata adds the API key to the request (header or query param)
    3. Tadata forwards request to the service
    4. Service validates the API key and responds
    5. Tadata returns response to AI agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Token Storage" icon="database">
    Tadata does NOT permanently store your API key. It's passed through on each request.

    **Your key never leaves your control.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Works with Any API" icon="plug">
    As long as the API accepts API keys (header or query param), you can use it:
    - Custom internal APIs
    - Self-hosted services
    - APIs without OAuth support
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Service Accounts" icon="robot">
    Use dedicated service accounts for automation:
    - Create an API key for "Tadata Bot" user
    - Actions appear under the bot name
    - Revoke bot key without affecting human users
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simple Setup" icon="bolt">
    No OAuth flows, no redirects. Just copy/paste the API key.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When to Use Passthrough

✅ **Use Passthrough when:**
- Service doesn't support OAuth
- You're integrating custom/internal APIs
- You want full control over credentials
- You prefer not to store tokens with Tadata

❌ **Don't use Passthrough when:**
- OAuth is available (it's more secure)
- You need automatic token refresh
- You want user-specific actions (not service account)

## Security Best Practices

Regardless of authentication method:

### General Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Least Privilege" icon="user-shield">
    Grant minimum necessary permissions:
    - OAuth: Select only required scopes during authorization
    - API Keys: Create restricted/scoped keys when possible

    **Example:** If you only need to read Linear issues, don't grant write permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Environments" icon="sitemap">
    Use different accounts for:
    - **Development**: Test workspace, limited permissions
    - **Staging**: Staging environment, broader access
    - **Production**: Production environment, full access

    This limits the blast radius if something goes wrong.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage" icon="eye">
    Regularly review:
    - [Analytics](/optimization/analytics) for unusual tool usage
    - Service audit logs for unexpected actions
    - Connected accounts for unauthorized access

    Set up alerts for anomalies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Credentials Regularly" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **For API Keys:**
    - Rotate every 90 days minimum
    - Rotate immediately if compromised
    - Use automated rotation if available

    **For OAuth:**
    - Tokens auto-refresh, but review connected accounts quarterly
    - Revoke and reconnect if account permissions change
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### OAuth-Specific

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Permissions During Authorization" icon="clipboard-check">
    When authorizing, carefully review what Tadata is requesting:
    - Read vs. write access
    - Scope of access (all repos vs. specific repos)
    - Duration (if applicable)

    Only authorize if permissions are reasonable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revoke Unused Connections" icon="trash">
    Periodically review connected accounts and disconnect:
    - Services you no longer use
    - Test accounts that are no longer needed
    - Duplicate connections

    Fewer connections = smaller attack surface.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Passthrough-Specific

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Scoped/Restricted API Keys" icon="key">
    Many services allow creating keys with limited permissions:
    - **Read-only keys** for fetching data
    - **Scoped keys** for specific resources (e.g., one GitHub repo)
    - **IP-restricted keys** (if Tadata IP ranges are known)

    Use the most restrictive key that works.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't Reuse API Keys" icon="clone">
    Create unique API keys for Tadata. Don't reuse keys from:
    - Local development
    - Other services/integrations
    - Shared team keys

    This makes it easier to revoke if compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store Keys Securely in Transit" icon="lock">
    When configuring API keys:
    - Use HTTPS (Tadata enforces this)
    - Don't email or Slack API keys
    - Use password managers to share keys securely
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth authorization fails" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms:** Redirect fails, "Authorization denied" error

    **Solutions:**
    - Disable popup blockers
    - Try in an incognito/private browser window
    - Verify you have admin access to the workspace/organization
    - Check service status (is OAuth down?)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token expired or revoked" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:** Tools fail with "401 Unauthorized" in Playground

    **Solutions:**
    - Go to Settings → Connected Accounts
    - Find the failing account
    - Click **Reconnect**
    - Re-authorize with the service
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API key not working" icon="key-skeleton">
    **Symptoms:** "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden" with passthrough

    **Solutions:**
    - Double-check API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
    - Verify key hasn't expired
    - Confirm key has necessary permissions
    - Check header name and prefix (e.g., "Bearer " with space)
    - Test API key directly with curl/Postman
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient permissions" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:** Some tools work, others fail with "403 Forbidden"

    **Solutions:**
    - Review OAuth scopes granted during authorization
    - For API keys, check key permissions in service dashboard
    - Reconnect OAuth with broader scopes if needed
    - Create a new API key with more permissions
  </Accordion>
